Home is more than just a building; it is a feeling that wraps around you like a warm blanket. The walls hold stories of laughter, late-night conversations, and quiet moments of reflection. Every corner carries memories—old photographs on the shelf, a favorite chair by the window, and the faint aroma of home-cooked meals that linger in the air. Outside, the garden may bloom with flowers that change with the seasons, but inside, it is the comfort, safety, and love of the people who live there that truly make it a home. No matter how far one travels, the heart always finds its way back to this familiar sanctuary.
